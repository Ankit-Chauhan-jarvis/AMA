        "text": "Yeah, hi. So, yeah, Emily asked me to give an insight into what is the ad glossary to discuss deployments, what you request about and why we should focus on it. So today, when we speak about the delivery domain, there are some core concepts like environments, deployments, releases, artifacts, perhaps. You can think anything around secure software supply chain that's involved. And it's not obvious what we mean by all of these words, especially when we use them as nouns, whereas we use them as verbs. And the glossary aims to have a common vocabulary for us to discuss the topic itself. We started to work on this with Mikhail a long, long time ago. And I would say that it's a very interesting topic. And I think it's a very interesting topic that you had lots of experience with yourself. Hope you don't electricissa bail on us. I would even say that we got to the point where we wanted to merge it and so that this is good enough. And we read describes how you imagine the best word that you could have within GitLab. But it was just so far away from what the lab offers that we never got to the point to merge it, because it's co wh Secondly, the but I could simply imagine you sort of deploy, you put this and so on, and what I would like to do is that I would like us to focus first on the glossary of how we imagine the best possible version, how we want to discuss that, and then describe as well what GitLab will do today and see how we can later on move the two together. So that's the plan and it will basically help us afterwards to discuss any of our topics. I will give you one very specific example which is the releases within GitLab, the releases object within GitLab that I find really confusing because to me a release is the final part of delivery when the software reaches the user. And if you think about open source development and GitHub and the releases, then the release is the final part of the delivery. So if you think about open source development and GitHub and the releases, then once a release appears on the GitHub release page, it's way to users. You can download it and use. But if a release is about a software service product, then the release is more of a feature flex which it's more like a different action that happens when you release something. So that's pretty confusing to me. It would be nice to have a common understanding of all these terms and how they relate to each other and how a code change reaches the user basically. I think that's the intro. I don't know if you have any questions related to that."

But probably we want to put in a user doc side, not like a development doc side, because that's not surface for users. And then like, I think Victor pointed out, had a good point that this doc should have a, you know, a lot of things. It should be over the overview of release and configure stages. So it should be like it should contain more like overview stuff. For example, like this is documentation I was writing aside from that. This is a deployment patterns in Microsoft's architecture. architecture, so when this documentation intends to explain how deployment workflow works with these vocabularies, there's artifact, there's releases, there's application, these all vocabularies are defined nicely, but it's kind of hard to wrap up how these are connected, how these are going to be projected into GitLab project architectures, like how users should organize their GitLab projects, something like that. So I was wondering that we can expand, generalize this a bit more from overview perspective. Yeah, these points are basically like I had in my mind when I see this on request."
