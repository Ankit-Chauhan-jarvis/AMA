I've heard that we have now a glossary template for documentation, but I don't know if it's used. And but pretty sure it wasn't for reasons to somebody wanted to use it. But I don't know any specific usage of it."

So it'll be kind of for both use cases for us to describe, like discussing internal features as we're building them and then customers to review if they have confusion over our wordings for things."

How do you expect us to kind of work through this? Is it something we want to take this as inspiration and work from scratch or work from this MR to fix it up? What's kind of."

What we have, like, you can say Timo had a bunch of comments, I think, back in January. So, and he could easily pick up and add these questions and topics there. So I think it can be used as a starting point as well. But I'm open to any option."

      "text": "I would like. As all of you, and ask me call specifically to dedicate to not dedicate that's that's that means different. I think I'd get lab, then at other places. But anyway, dedicate two weeks to the summer, which means that all of us the whole team knows that for those two weeks. This Mr is in focus. And we want to close it by the end of the second week. That would be my idea and then we can work on the async, because we know that there is a lot of attention on the MRM and it's, it's not that we are going to wait a week to get a response. What she knows sometimes has to wait a week for my responses. But in that case, so to have more urgency on it for a very well defined period of time. And then. That would be my idea to tackle it."

      "text": "Just if we want to merge quickly. I have one comment that can we drop some like very specific. Specifications. Like for example artifact, you must contain a crop to crop to crop crop cryptographically signed. This is something like. Then like artifacts. So like, I wonder if we can generalize a bit more so that we can you know move on like more details later."

      "speaker": "SPEAKER_04",
      "text": "against that. Yeah. With this specific example that you gave. I think yes. I don't know what as we would find to, to make it smaller, and overall. I think. I think. I think that merging a sloppy terminology is worse than not having a terminology. that's, that's, that's why. So, with the example shared I would agree that we can merge it even without that, because it doesn't affect the whole flow on the other hand if you're like, what we have a discussion on, on what does a release mean, and it came out that it might not be even needed there. I, I wouldn't know what to merge at this point. And I think it would just cause confusion that we merged the one wording and a week later we want to change it. But there are cases where likely we can simplify."

      "text": "Yeah. Can we try to iterate on it, maybe split it in like for example we can just merge it. Yeah, we can. We can merge an empty page, which says, this is a glossary. This is the purpose of it. And don't merge any exact terms now. And then just open another, I don't know, 510 merge requests with specific stuff which we can discuss which will be much smaller can can be merged within a few days. Because right now, it looks way too big. And I don't know. Two weeks timeline also feels to me. But no, we can do it. Even like we can give two days for like comments and addressing them, and then just merge and then iterate. I just feel like this MR is way too big to be merged in a single piece, because it will create way too many discussions."

Or some similar symbols that shows that this is a plant thing. And doesn't exist yet or or something that that's one of the reasons why we didn't want it to put it in the user dog actually."

Yeah. You were on that issue that tiger. Created the example project on how to organize deployments. We could use it there as well because what to deploy isn't a sense of artifact. And you could easily describe that that's not. But it's all CIA major separate branch. That's not. So there as well. What I would say that initially it would be internal, but as we build features, it becomes more and more user -facing."
