    "text": " Hey everyone, this is the design pair session on March 30th and today we're going to work, walk through the glossary to discuss deployments. So I'll hand this off to Victor to give an intro and then we can jump into it after. Yeah, hi. So, yeah, Emily asked me to give an insight into what is the ad glossary to discuss deployments, what you request about and why we should focus on it. So today, when we speak about the delivery domain, there are some core concepts like environments, deployments, releases, artifacts, perhaps. You can think anything around secure software supply chain that's involved. And it's not obvious what we mean by all of these words, especially when we use them as nouns, whereas we use them as verbs. And the glossary aims to have a common vocabulary for us to discuss the topic itself. We started to work on this with Mikhail a long, long time ago. And I would say that it's a very interesting topic. And I think it's a very interesting topic to talk about. And then if we can, I want to usually go back to maybe into learning landscapes which are the mid-term, which are the typical exercises that we've learned. And then I think as a beginner, you get a bit more mad about some of the money things on top of the Multi-lingual獎. How do you see this working? Thank you, waters. And well, I think maybe, well, still, let me weren't clear at this stage, it's really clear what we're trying to do at the moment. I would like us to focus first on the glossary of how we imagine the best possible way, how we want to discuss that. And then describe as well what GitLab will do today and see how we can later on move the two together. So that's the plan. And it will basically help us afterwards to discuss any of our topics. I will give you one very specific example, which is the releases within GitLab, the releases object within GitLab, that I find really confusing. Because to me, a release is the final part of delivery when the software reaches the user. And if you think about open source development and GitHub and the releases, then once you have the release, you have to think about the release. Once a release appears on the GitHub release page, it's made with users. You can download it and use. But if a release is about a software as a service product, then the release is more of a feature flex switch. It's more like a different action that happens when you release something. So that, for example, is pretty confusing to me. It would be nice to have a common understanding of all these terms and how they relate to each other. And that's the first step. And then the second step is how a code change reaches the user. Basically, that's the, I think that's the intro. I don't know if you have any questions related to that. I have one. Do we have any glossaries like this in GitLab so far in the other stage groups or anywhere else? I don't know of anything in this. Way. What? No, I don't know anything like that. I've heard. I've heard about from Philly. I've heard that we have now a glossary template for documentation, but I don't know if it's used. And but pretty sure it wasn't for reasons to somebody wanted to use it. But I don't know any specific usage of it. And one. Other question. The ideal, like intended, this is going to be in the docs, right? From what I can see in the MR and it'll be useful for both us and our customers. So it'll be kind of for both use cases for us to describe, like discussing internal features as we're building them and then customers to review if they have confusion over our wordings for things. Yeah, exactly. And then sorry, one other question. There is a lot of work. Done on this. And I know you said that we kind of went in a direction and then stopped going forward. How do you expect us to kind of work through this? Is it something we want to take this as inspiration and work from scratch or work from this MR to fix it up? What's kind of. I'm open to either approach. Whatever. You think is the best to do. Yeah. First, I think it's a pretty good start. What we have, like, you can say Timo had a bunch of comments, I think, back in January. So, and he could easily pick up and add these questions and topics there. So I think it can be used as a starting point as well. But I'm open to any option. Okay. I also noticed you and Philip were in here. Yesterday, too. So it seems like there's still work going on. So I think it makes sense if the comments don't make it too messy to continue from to just work from this one. Yeah, it's it's it was really always on my mind to merge it. Just like when we started it. I very quickly realized that a big part of the scope is outside of the domain that I was responsible for back then. And actually, when I was the acting group manager from the beginning. From September, I asked Chris. And I think together with China to start working on this lottery. Because then the two really then configure groups on the whole domain. Basically, time change everything we know that and but now be the environment on the domain and and we can finally, it's a single hand, so to say and we can finish the work I think. Okay. So I think we could probably put like a milestone on this just to actually get a date on finishing it because I feel like that's another thing that probably kept it going. We didn't have any. We had we had my son on a long long time ago. Yeah. So put like a due date into it and then I probably should have invited, invited Philip to this one to this design pairing session just to discuss this because I feel like he'll be a big part of it. Yeah. But, but yeah, does anyone else have any questions I know Shinya you worked on this a little bit before, as well, but I have a questions. This guy just have a few points on this work. This module guess that having this bookable is glossary is in our documentation will be good. But probably we want to put in a user doc side, not like a development doc side, because that's not surface to for users. And then like, I think Victor pointed out that had a good point that this doc should have her overview of police and configure stages. So, it should be like a. It should contain more like overview stuff. For example, Like this is a documentation, I was writing. Aside from that, This is a deep, deep limit patterns in Microsoft its architecture. So when this documentation, the intense to explain like how deployment walk for works각 with these book abilities. Like, You know, there's artifact is a releases, there's application, these all vocabularies are defined nicely. But we, it's kind of hard to wrap up, like how these are connected, like how these going to be projected into give up project project architectures like how users should organize their gila projects, something like that. So, I was wondering that we can expand. Generalize this bit more. From overview perspective. Yeah, these points are basically like, I had a in my mind. When I see this on your request. Okay, I tried to take a note of what you said. I'm not sure that I captured your ideas correctly so please check in the docs. Right. I didn't. I didn't. I'm not sure that I captured all the words for sure, but I tried to capture the ideas that you can. And, and I like them. I agree. I guess, going forward with this. What, what do you expect kind of the plan to be I guess I can help push it forward. But how do we want to work on this and how do we want to get it done because I think it's going to be like. It's going to be like a team effort to get everything in there not one person. I would like. As all of you, and ask me call specifically to dedicate to not dedicate that's that's that means different. I think I'd get lab, then at other places. But anyway, dedicate two weeks to the summer, which means that all of us the whole team knows that for those two weeks. This Mr is in focus. And we want to close it by the end of the second week. That would be my idea and then we can work on the async, because we know that there is a lot of attention on the MRM and it's, it's not that we are going to wait a week to get a response. What she knows sometimes has to wait a week for my responses. But in that case, so to have more urgency on it for a very well defined period of time. And then. That would be my idea to tackle it. Just if we want to merge quickly. I have one comment that can we drop some like very specific. Specifications. Like for example artifact, you must contain a crop to crop to crop crop cryptographically signed. This is something like. Then like artifacts. So like, I wonder if we can generalize a bit more so that we can you know move on like more details later. Um, doesn't matter. I'm not against that. Yeah. With this specific example that you gave. I think yes. I don't know what as we would find to, to make it smaller, and overall. I think. I think. I think that merging a sloppy terminology is worse than not having a terminology. Hmm. I agree. So that's, that's, that's why. So, with the example shared I would agree that we can merge it even without that, because it doesn't affect the whole flow on the other hand if you're like, what we have a discussion on, on what does a release mean, and it came out that it might not be even needed there. I, I wouldn't know what to merge at this point. And I think it would just cause confusion that we merged the one wording and a week later we want to change it. But there are cases where likely we can simplify. It's almost like we have to decide which, like, Vlad do you want to voice your point because I think it's similar to what I was about to say. Yeah. Can we try to iterate on it, maybe split it in like for example we can just merge it. Yeah, we can. We can merge an empty page, which says, this is a glossary. This is the purpose of it. And don't merge any exact terms now. And then just open another, I don't know, 510 merge requests with specific stuff which we can discuss which will be much smaller can can be merged within a few days. Because right now, it looks way too big. And I don't know. Two weeks timeline also feels to me. But no, we can do it. Even like we can give two days for like comments and addressing them, and then just merge and then iterate. I just feel like this MR is way too big to be merged in a single piece, because it will create way too many discussions. Yeah, it's almost like we have to break off certain terminologies and start with just certain ones. Yeah. Perfect those certain ones and then move on to others instead of trying to do them all in one. I'm not sure how we would break those off. But to Victor's point we don't want to merge like sloppy terminology that is not fully agreed on by the team. But maybe we could break it up and not have some for the first iteration. But I don't know if that would be helpful or not. I like the idea actually. I'm not. I don't know how they would execute. But I like both the idea of starting with an empty page. I did the plus one there and as well that likely we can we can try to separate a mark for not all the terms but like some terms, like, for example for targeting for structure just use it together with environments, but like these bigger terms, and, and that's okay. Two days on that two days on that, and we can even move back when we figure out that something is not right. So I think that's good. As you move forward. I like this. Kind of changing the subject. How do we plan to address the difference between this ideal terminology and what we want to mean and what we actually have in the product. To what, like I also read about the release, also being cryptography, clearly signed. Yeah. Hard word to say. And like, we have none of this right now. Yeah. And if especially if we use string your suggestion and move this to the user dogs, instead of development, then users can just go to us and ask questions like, where is this. This is how you define it and there is nothing of the sort in the GitLab. Yeah, I think we should be very clear on on plant features, perhaps having similar flags that we have for tiers on the page header. And then we can just go back to the user dog. Or some similar symbols that shows that this is a plant thing. And doesn't exist yet or or something that that's one of the reasons why we didn't want it to put it in the user dog actually. But why we need it somewhere is. I don't know if, if in your culture you have something similar but in in Hungary, the open stated. If you want to go to Paris. You have to know. Where Paris is otherwise we'll end up in Moscow. And I guess, never wanted to end up in Moscow with all our big poem, but went to Paris actually. So, that's why the glossary is is shows us the North Star, that we want to reach. And after that we can discuss if it's feasible at all. Again, there's. There's a lot of things that we can do. And then the steps to get there, and what falls on us and what was outside of that. And all of that. But without knowing where we want to get it's hard to get there. We have only have like a whole page in the handbook dedicated to North stars and product directions and things like that. I mean, our direction pages are roughly that. So, in the handbook. This would be a perfect fit, you can. I think we can put anything in the handbook roughly. The user dog is the big question there I think. Yeah, I only mentioned this because I think the goal of user documentation is to document things as they are today right. Whereas we have we like we have a whole section somewhere else dedicated to direction. We could merge it on the direction page actually. I need to rewrite it anyway. So. Just capturing notes. Well, that makes sense. So it did. We want the timeline to be on this did we want to start working on it ASAP. This milestone next milestone, kind of. When should we make plans to do these like today or two week. Not sprints but periods of time where we want to focus on this effort. I think it's pretty urgent actually. Because we are working in this domain and that's having a vocabulary to discuss things that's a bit awkward to start with. At the same time, it's, it doesn't. It's not a critical issue or anything like that so. So, Now I have two questions in my head that doesn't allow me to give a more specific answer to me to your question and one is this handbook or docs question. Because we can merge an empty page in any of these. Anytime. Basically, The handbook especially it's super easy. We don't even need special approval isn't it. And the other question is the breakdown that you mentioned, and you will be gone by next Monday. And I think it will be really helpful if once we merge the empty page. If you Emily or me could work together with one of you the engineers to quickly open the page. And then we can see how we can open all these Mars. How we think the first. The first split of the big Mr. So to say. Starting. At the same time I don't want it to take a huge amount of. I don't. I should pay more on that but if anyone has ideas how to approach it, or how I will do it is, I would create an empty page. I would create an empty page. Inside the direction. I think that was a great idea from Andrew. And we can do it today. And then. I guess you Victor you can. Find like five terms that you find the most important right now. Just copy existing. Text which you already have an open in the more wisdom. And we can discuss them. And then every week every couple weeks we can create another merge request. Moving more and more. Again, for this existing content and discussing. Instead of opening like. Then. A more simultaneous like yes it will distract everybody. Way too much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. To. To Victor's point of having a plan out about the MRS we could also just open an issue that has the list of what points. We think we want to open and just have it collected. Somewhere. So it's not like busying up anywhere, but we do have it like down on paper that we want to get all of these open in the next month or so. I can do that. I can, I can open it. Sure. Oh, well, I think that was pretty productive in. Getting a plan down to get this work done. So thanks everyone for your input on this. Does anyone else have any comments or questions? Overall, there are eight. Terms defined in the MR. So the opening five. Like find five terms that almost describes everything. Just quick question. When. For example, when do we use this doc? Like when we talking with customer or will we talking with, I mean like a. Give me one example. Yeah. We would use it. So we planned to run a design sprint for environment. And for example, there, this will be very likely to produce for. We would use it for deployments like. I think. Yeah. You were on that issue that tiger. Created the example project on how to organize deployments. We could use it there as well because what to deploy isn't a sense of artifact. And you could easily describe that that's not. But it's all CIA major separate branch. That's not. So there as well. What I would say that initially it would be internal, but as we build features, it becomes more and more user-facing. Okay. So. We could open refer. To the page in that issue description. When we talking about the future spec. Okay. Thank you. Yes. That's a. Yeah. Okay. So. So. So. So. So. So. So just to summarize Victor, you'll open up the issue with the planned. We'll open the first MR around the blank page today. And that'll kind of get us started on this. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So I think that kind of ends our main topic. I just want to make sure open it to, if we have any ongoing. Engineering work that kind of needs a design discussion. Not, I guess we can. And this early, if no one else has anything. Okay. I guess we can. We can. We can. I think that's all. Sounds good. And I think I mentioned that at the start, but I don't know if everyone is here. I just put a little async retro. In the agenda. There's a recommendations or feedback. You have for how this meeting's going now that we're a month in. But otherwise, thanks for the discussion. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",
