      "text": "Yeah, for sure. Well, in a previous role, I got to mentor like like half the interns sort of yearly, like all those sort of back under front end interns that you get to sort of speak with. There's loads of UX interns and stuff in the previous role as well and product management interns. I love that. So in the Belfast office, we sort of had like up to like 12 interns sort of initially. And then I was 12. And I was 12 to 15 and 20. And it increased from 20 even since I've left. And I really thought that program was great. It's really, really a good way to get in a bunch of junior engineers. There was a bigger to learn and happy to jump on board and learn stuff."

There was sort of a lack of maintainers available and because I was already in the area anyways, I got moved from a reviewer to maintainer. So yeah, if anybody needs reviews, I'm happy to help now."

      "text": "Well, I know how to get points on a different thread that I've just thought of, uh, where right now we're doing an import to the file and it's committed into get, but instead of doing that, what we could do is we could keep the import the same way. And the import with ES bundle, we can actually download the file during build. Time to pull in the, the Jason schema. And so that could pull it from the actual registry and that way you had to be a build time failure if the file didn't exist in, and then we'd be using the file exactly as it was in the registry at build time, at least. So that's one way to go about it. But yeah, snowplow micro is running a snowplow, uh, locally. So whenever we're doing snowplow tracking, we can send it to our local registry instead of the GitLab, uh, server for the telemetry. And so when you're sending it to that local Docker container in the service, you can test things in a way that because the local snowplow micro will also pull the, from the production registry to check that all the metrics are good. And then still, I will do additional validation that you can't get. Um, so still plot Michael will actually give a list of like bad, bad events that it received. And so we can literally end the job, run our whole suite of integration tests. And if there's any bad events, we can err on the build and say, Hey, this bad event. Events was received by snowplow."

      "text": "Yeah. So it's easy. So, yeah, I guess we can improve the way we're doing the poll, but right now it was a manual process to do the polling. I thought I've, I'm going to add our job, which will fail your MR. If there's been a change since the last time it's been merged domain, but the, yeah, we need, we need some way to push. Like if the new glue thing is there, get like do something we can maybe do a nightly job even where we run the lens job nightly. And if it fails on main, then we got to eat like an email that would even, that would be a small iteration. That'd be an improvement."
