Today is September 28th, and we have a couple things on the agenda. The first one is from Lena, who is not on the call, but is asking, how should we automate the language server upgrades in the extensions? I'm just going to bump letter B up here, just because that's like the current proposal, which was my proposal. Just like, let's create an epic that says, here, there's a new version everyone should upgrade. And this way, at least we can track. So we went ahead and did that for now, and have issues for like, NeoVim for Visual Studio and for VS Code. But there is, so Tristan put a point here as well, that we could use RenovateBot to create MRs with each new release. And was asking if the language server is part of the extension repository, which I'm not sure what that means actually, reading it. I'm going to read what Tristan says here. He was thinking that the GitLab UI model could work for us. They have a, they generate change log and releases from commits using semantic release, and the commit message body may optionally signify a breaking change, and therefore a major version bump. And there are more details in the link. So we need to lint our commits, but it will automate a lot of the process for us. Okay. And then Renovate could automatically open and assign MRs in the other projects on the specific schedule. Yeah. So I think this is a really good idea and we should do it. I don't think we should do it right now, but I think we should just open an issue to"

So I'm just going to go ahead and do that. And then I'm going to go ahead and do that. I've also kind of roughly shoved at the top of each column the current issues that are kind of being worked on or are important.

So if I have two of my choices here, for example, write the context that I'm going to write, and that means day five and that means day seven. And respect the работ, and I want to experience if things go well. I read one question from a previous session that I read I had another one two minutes later, which is whether or not students understand what's going to be done during or say, in general, is an issue.

I want to propose to just use dedicated Milestones for each project, like just not use the, I don't know what to call it, canonical, the main GitLab or GitLab Milestones because they just actually are meaningless. So I'm going to just use the extension of the code, which is the same as the name of the code we use for the extensions. All they mean is, you know, from, well, you know what they mean. Anyway, so my question, I want to just try this out to see what breaks, basically. I don't want to just make a list of what could break and be worried about it. So my question is, but before I do that, as engineers, as developers, is there something that you know would immediately break in your workflow with your MRs, your issues if we were to not use those Milestones anymore?

So I think about like aligning with the web IDE on OAuth authentication, right? Or like aligning with the changes. So the code suggestions API, right? Those are going to be shipped in Milestones. So we're going to have to interface with that to some degree. I'm wondering if like, I found the way that the language server like protocol itself is versioned to be convenient, where like they just ship out like whatever's on main as like a pre -release, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like, we could just cut it whenever they're ready to cut a release. So like, maybe we could just like be always shipping a pre -release version of the language server and maybe the extensions also. But then we actually cut the release along with everybody else on the fixed cadence. It's just a thought."

And I'm almost asking this because in the Visual Studio one, we've tried to have some common interface and implement both paths, but we're already at a point where that common interface is no longer going to work. So my suggestion for the Visual Studio side of things would be just to, we're going to stick with the TypeScript LSP and remove all references to go."

The code suggestions itself in the future is in GA, so it just confused a hell of a lot of users if we did that. So, but internally, we're very proud of ourselves and the work that we accomplished because we managed to hit that. So thank you everyone. This is awesome. Cool. Yeah. Well, if there's nothing else, we can wrap it up."
