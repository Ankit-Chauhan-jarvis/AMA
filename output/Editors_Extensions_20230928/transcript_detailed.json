    "text": " All right, awesome. We are live. Welcome everyone to the Editor Extension Group Team Weekly Sync. We need a longer name for this call. Today is September 28th, and we have a couple things on the agenda. The first one is from Lena, who is not on the call, but is asking, how should we automate the language server upgrades in the extensions? I'm just going to bump letter B up here, just because that's like the current proposal, which was my proposal. Just like, let's create an epic that says, here, there's a new version everyone should upgrade. And this way, at least we can track. So we went ahead and did that for now, and have issues for like, NeoVim for Visual Studio and for VS Code. But there is, so Tristan put a point here as well, that we could use RenovateBot to create MRs with each new release. And was asking if the language server is part of the extension repository, which I'm not sure what that means actually, reading it. I'm going to read what Tristan says here. He was thinking that the GitLab UI model could work for us. They have a, they generate change log and releases from commits using semantic release, and the commit message body may optionally signify a breaking change, and therefore a major version bump. And there are more details in the link. So we need to lint our commits, but it will automate a lot of the process for us. Okay. And then Renovate could automatically open and assign MRs in the other projects on the specific schedule. Yeah. So I think this is a really good idea and we should do it. I don't think we should do it right now, but I think we should just open an issue to remember to do that and track it. I think for now, maybe that the boring solution of creating issues manually is okay. Do you have a question, John? Do you, are you- Yeah, it's actually, yes, one. And then I was actually going to ask, are we doing this? Are we doing any kind of like semantic commits right now or like semantic versioning? The doc should be in the invite. We're definitely not enforcing semantic. Okay. But I think we've been loosely following semantic versioning. Okay. Okay. Because I know, I know, I, the only reason I'm asking is I know that I was talking with Mike and he was, he was mentioning this specific issue. And was concerned about doing automated, you know, automated linking of a new version of the LSP to a project just because sometimes things that look like they're not breaking changes were actually breaking changes to, to something in the VS world or something like that. So it could easily quickly break us without us knowing it's supposed to break. Yeah. I think that's the advantage of using something like renovate, but I think it makes sense to like automate creation of the, of the update it, but not just, but not to go ahead and automatically do it. Yeah. I like that too. Yeah. I like the idea of, if we have like the, in our Git lab, like CI CD pipeline, if we have an accept acceptance tests running, whenever renovate triggers NMR, actually give us some level of confidence. Of course, there's going to be outliers. But if we're forcing major version bumps for breaking changes, and we have acceptance and sustenance as we're agreeing, then the basic user scenario should be covered then. Cool. Sounds good. I think a first step that we could take would be getting all the extensions to install based on the NPM package, because I assume that's what's going to be the most seamless with the Renovate bot setup. Yeah, and I think the only one right now, both NuVim and Visuals TS Code are doing that, I think. But not Visual Studio. As far as I can tell, Visual Studio just had the pre-built binary just versioned in the... in the repository, so that would be something to change there. Cool. Does anyone want to volunteer to create that issue? Does anyone want me to name a volunteer? I can do it. Thank you. Cool. John, before we move on, John, just so you can unmute and just talk, or let me know if you have any questions, or anything you'd like to add. Yeah, I think we can just do like right in the doc. You don't have to like raise a hand or ask. This will be like all new meeting stuff, but feel free to just like interrupt and say whatever you want. Okay, cool. Until I know my way around, I don't want to just go, hey, I've got things to say, because... That's fair, but we do like to interrupt each other. No, it's not that we like to interrupt each other. It's just we think it's an important way to communicate effectively, remotely. Otherwise, it's just, yeah, it gets difficult. So feel free to interrupt. Cool. All right. I think we can move on to the next point then, which is what I wrote there. Okay. So FYI, I created an issue board for the team. This is prompted by Amy. Thank you, Amy, because actually, it's well overdue. And you're kind of like, oh, I don't know. Eventually, so right now, the board is just like all the issues that are like tagged with our team's label and with a column for each of the like extensions slash language server. So I'm just going to go ahead and do that. And then I'm going to go ahead and do that. I've also kind of roughly shoved at the top of each column the current issues that are kind of being worked on or are important. I think eventually it would be nice that for us to use this or some version of this to keep track of our priorities at the issue level. I just wanted to see if people had thoughts on that. But before that, I guess, Amy, you have your next point. Sure. So you can tell whether or not I've been poking my nose into a technical issue or I've put my head on a PC, and I immediately richt it out to one mock can write what I think I want to hear. I also think an issue should have been a technical writing. So if I have two of my choices here, for example, write the context that I'm going to write, and that means day five and that means day seven. And respect the работ, and I want to experience if things go well. I read one question from a previous session that I read I had another one two minutes later, which is whether or not students understand what's going to be done during or say, in general, is an issue. And then something comes up that's already been talked about at sub point seven. So what's my strategy? Or do you know if the patient might need to get an issue? can attest that once you get stuck with me, you're stuck with me. Sorry, Kai. She's the best. If you've ever worked with another tech writer, she's the best. Your bribe will be in the mail shortly. Thank you. Kai had a read-only here about a link about how we could do that. Cool. Yeah. I think how we end up framing issues on the board is likely informed by how we decide we want to use Milestone across four projects that don't actually have anything to do with Milestone because we need some sort of work time period grouping and then some other thing to tell us when it was actually released. Yes. Correct. So let me do something here where I'm going to jump to number four by removing number three and therefore number four is now number three. So let's move to the next item in the agenda, which is number three, which is about our use of Milestones. So, yeah, FYI, Kai created this issue. I want to propose to just use dedicated Milestones for each project, like just not use the, I don't know what to call it, canonical, the main GitLab or GitLab Milestones because they just actually are meaningless. So I'm going to just use the extension of the code, which is the same as the name of the code we use for the extensions. All they mean is, you know, from, well, you know what they mean. Anyway, so my question, I want to just try this out to see what breaks, basically. I don't want to just make a list of what could break and be worried about it. So my question is, but before I do that, as engineers, as developers, is there something that you know would immediately break in your workflow with your MRs, your issues if we were to not use those Milestones anymore? Like the main GitLab ones? I mean. Yeah. The biggest issue I see is alignment with features that are inevitably going to be released on like a fixed Milestone cadence. So I think about like aligning with the web IDE on OAuth authentication, right? Or like aligning with the changes. So the code suggestions API, right? Those are going to be shipped in Milestones. So we're going to have to interface with that to some degree. I'm wondering if like, I found the way that the language server like protocol itself is versioned to be convenient, where like they just ship out like whatever's on main as like a pre-release, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like, we could just cut it whenever they're ready to cut a release. So like, maybe we could just like be always shipping a pre-release version of the language server and maybe the extensions also. But then we actually cut the release along with everybody else on the fixed cadence. It's just a thought. I will also need to check with Diana, my manager, to find out if there's any issues with that. And then also to find out if we've got any reporting in the tech running team that is Milestone dependent. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. I know you said you don't want to know, like, try and make the exhaustive list of what we'll break. Accounting is one that comes to mind that like there might be unhappy people if we inadvertently break it. Because I think we do some accounting based on time periods. Based on the amount of time. Yeah. And then also based on the labels that are assigned to work. And so if they can't correlate those to like the correct quarters and months, that might mess up some stuff on there. Yeah. My secret hope, or it's not secret, my hope is that these kinds of reporting use months and not Milestones. It's just, of course, we know that a Milestone is more or less a month here. But that's kind of, you know, consequences. I suspect they all use the Milestone. Because that's how we pull data. And that's how all the engineering metric tables are done. Are you sure about that? Like, when I look at these KPIs, like, they're per month. Like, at least last time I did look at them. Anyway, so maybe I'll need to have a closer look again. Or, yeah. Okay. Is it maybe worth reaching out to Lily? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just ping her. And just be like, hey, here's, if we didn't have a Milestone label on the whole group of work, like, what would we do? Yeah. Who would hate us? Okay. I will ask her. Cool. All right. Let's move on to the next point. Also mine. FYI, I added this section to our team handbook. I called it knowledge sharing. I didn't know what to call it. Forgive me. We have a tech writer now. Maybe you can help me with my struggles. The goal of this basically was, like, I kept finding, like, I kept looking for knowledge, like, about how do we do X in this experience. How do we do the same thing in this other extension? What about this one? What about this one? And I don't want to store this in my head. And I don't want to store this in the extensions themselves because it's meta information. It's more about this applies to all of them. So I didn't know where to put this. I just put it in the team handbook. I was like, whatever. I'll put it there. So I'm happy for any improvements, additions, suggestions of alternative locations as well. And I would just also use this to encourage everyone to always, like, take advice for action when you, like, especially about .NET, like, you know, like, you're not going to be able to do this. You're going to have to do this. Like, a lot of us are onboarding to this. Even the people who have been working on this for a long time have actually only been working on this for a couple months. So, like, there's plenty of things that have not been written down. And we should make sure to do more of that. And any kind of wordsmithing I'm happy to help with. Working on handbook stuff is a little more of a gray area for the Docs team. But I think it's a great way to get people to understand what you're doing. And more often than not, whatever is going in the handbook has something to do with a feature or something we're working on. I would rather just say, if you want your words edited, hi. Send it over. Cool. Thank you. Awesome. And, yeah, this is one thing that I'm struggling with sometimes. Like, well, should this go into Docs? But it doesn't feel very useful for, like, kind of the documentation thing. Like, which versions of the language are being, like, recorded? Who cares? Like, only I care, maybe, about this. I don't know. Throw it over the wall. We'll figure it out. Cool. Awesome. Marcio, you had the next point. Yeah. We got the VS Code integration merged yesterday. And I was working on typing out the I should have the inline completion stuff is working locally. I have, like, a little bit of a problem with that. So I can't actually see it. We're going to have to make some dependency bumps on the language server side. And then it necessarily involves updating the VS Code extension to the latest version of the language server and all that. So we should get a couple of these issues knocked out as a result. and yeah point being I should have to follow up stuff follow up MRS up today well Fiona you can feel free to tag me in the I'm a maintainer on the web id now as well so I'll accelerate that since I've had to do lots of language server stuff in the ovm you mean the not on the vs code extension I need to finish I'm still like in the progress for that no I gotta get that one too that's the one I need for that uh yeah I was just gonna ask is there I know like vs code has this like we merge things and then someone has to actually cut a release do you know if they've cut a release and then also is it a I assume it's like a setting like in settings json we have something we can hit true on and like are you it's what what that team has been calling like a feature line yeah settings.json but it's not like exposed as a extension setting okay but yeah if you enable that it should be working um and uh yeah I I don't know if it's been cut into into a release I don't know if that's all automated or not did not when it can you um can you find out when it is and then it would be good to get um I'd like to give it to Tim Zalman to test it uh yeah let me get the inline completion working because it's probably better to test but yeah we'll do all right cool I think so the reasons are definitely not automated I think last time we uh and I ended up asking shakar to to cut a release so either you become familiar with the process and try to do it yourself or find a maintainer or someone like shakar who can trigger the release when when needed awesome thank you that's great um John you have the next oh yeah sorry there's one one I'll ping uh Aaron on the MR but um this the inline completion stuff I'm working on for VS code introduces like a new protocol message that's part of like the um upcoming like 3.18 protocol for for inline completion um so we can we can coordinate on that but you'll have the option to listen for the inline completion event separate from the like drop down completion event oh this makes Marshall would it be then better to would you need to upgrade to the latest version of the language server then before you can do that or uh yeah I mentioned that that will okay sorry I missed that at the same time okay okay gotcha yeah cool I just assigned myself that other issue so great all right we can go to number six now John yeah cool yeah I just had a quick question around um so I know the LSP was originally written in golang and now we've moved over to TypeScript and as those versions and you know as we add more features of TypeScript and as we had breaking changes those are very different paths and most likely go is never going to be used again um is the should the goal be that we're removing go references um and um or references to that go Golang LSP in our extensions. And I'm almost asking this because in the Visual Studio one, we've tried to have some common interface and implement both paths, but we're already at a point where that common interface is no longer going to work. So my suggestion for the Visual Studio side of things would be just to, we're going to stick with the TypeScript LSP and remove all references to go. Yeah, I have no idea that the Visual Studio one was still referenced to go. Okay. Yeah, last week I had the same experience with NeoFM. I just had to rip all the support for both. I just had to rip all of it out because of the token check just changed the paradigm for how authentication worked so much. Yep. Cool, okay. So general consensus is let's go ahead and remove references to go. Yeah. Yes, we have consensus. And based on this consensus, Kai has archived the project definitely after consensus was reached. So all is good. Yay. Super fast. Kai's executive decision came through. I was the last project holding up the experiments group. So I was happy to finally just be like, all right, well, I'm done with this. It was also in my browser's autocomplete history. Every time I typed language server, it would take me to that project. And so that was really my secret reason for wanting to archive it. You'll learn to navigate GitLab through your browser history, not through GitLab at some point. And so like, it's really important that those links are correct. Yes. Cool. I have the same problem, by the way, or similar problem. Every time I navigate to the language server, I just end up on the Q and A, like onboarding issue that I created. I'm like, I don't care about this issue anymore. I want to see something else. So anyway. Cool. All right. We have nothing else in the written agenda. Anything people wanted to bring up or discuss? Ali, we didn't get to sync this week, but it looks like everything was going well and we're getting very close to being able to fit the telemetry on the JetBrains. Anything that we should discuss on this regard? No, nothing new. Hopefully we'll have a release. Tomorrow with telemetry enabled. Nice. Awesome. Cool. Oh, and by the way, for everyone who might not be aware, so we now officially consider Visual Studio and NeoVim to have, well, functional and working telemetry, which is kind of what's our criteria for internal GA, but we're not calling them GA just yet, like publicly and widely because they, these two extensions only support code suggestions. The code suggestions itself in the future is in GA, so it just confused a hell of a lot of users if we did that. So, but internally, we're very proud of ourselves and the work that we accomplished because we managed to hit that. So thank you everyone. This is awesome. Cool. Yeah. Well, if there's nothing else, we can wrap it up.",
